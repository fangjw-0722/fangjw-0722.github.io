# About Me

<img src="/images/Teaser.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Jiawei Fang (方家卫)**.<br>

My vision is to build a *close-loop* emboided system. Previously, I was a research intern at Carnegie Mellon University in the Computer Science Department and a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley in the Mechanical Engineering Department, mentored by [Prof. Lining Yao](https://morphingmatter.org/people) and University of Washington, mentored by [Prof. Yiyue Luo](https://yyueluo.com/index.html). I am now mentored by [Prof. Wojciech Matusik](https://cdfg.csail.mit.edu/wojciech).

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - jiaweif[at]stu.xmu.edu.com

    <h3>Research Vision</h3>

<p>
My long-term goal is to build <b>closed-loop embodied intelligence systems</b>
that integrate sensing, physical simulation, and generative AI.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wearable & on-body sensing</li>
  <li>Simulation-in-the-loop co-design</li>
  <li>LLM agents for generative design</li>
  <li>Embodied AI & robotics</li>
</ul>

<p>
I aim to bridge <b>AI, HCI, and Robotics</b> to create scalable,
deployable physical intelligence systems.
