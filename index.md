# About Me

<img src="/images/Teaser.jpg" class="floatpic">


Here is **Jiawei Fang (方家卫)**.<br>

My vision is to build a *close-loop* emboided system. Previously, I was a research intern at Carnegie Mellon University in the Computer Science Department, mentored by [Prof. Lining Yao](https://morphingmatter.org/people) and University of Washington, mentored by [Prof. Yiyue Luo](https://yyueluo.com/index.html). I was previously working as a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley in the Mechanical Engineering Department thanks to Prof. Yao’s support.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - jiaweif[at]stu.xmu.edu.com
